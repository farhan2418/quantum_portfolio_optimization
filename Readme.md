## Guided Quantum walk for portfolio optimization

**This project is an effort to extend the guided quantum walk and compare it with other state-of-the-art quantum algorithms such as VQA and QAOA to the famous financial problem called portfolio optimization.**

- This project also focuses on the necessary financial aspect for building portfolio such as computing historical-mean returns, risk-volatility, sharpe ratio and many more.
- requirements.text will contain all the necessary packages.

*A detailed description on the project and how to install it will be updated soon.*
